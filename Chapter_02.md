# Mathematical Preliminaries
## Sets, Relations and Functions
- Distinguish functions which can fail from functions which diverge
- A predicate $P$ is *preserved* by binary relation $R$ iff whenever $s\,\, R\,\, t$  and $P(s)$ then $P(t)$ 
## Ordered sets
### Definitions
- *preorder*
- *partial order*
- *join*, *meet*
- *equivlance*
- *transitive closure*, *reflexive closure*
- *decreasing chain*, *well-founded*
## Sequences
- use comma as both `cons` and `append`
## Induction
- induction on natural numbers and lexicographic tuples
